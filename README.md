# Vid2Txt
This Python script converts MP4 videos without subtitles into text files. Simply input an MP4 video, and it will generate a corresponding .txt file in the same directory. It is free to use for educational purposes. Although the accuracy is high, errors may still occur, so it's not suitable for commercial use.
